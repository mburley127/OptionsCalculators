## Option Pricing Models

This repository contains implementations of various option pricing models in Python. The models included are:

1. **Binomial Model**
   - The Binomial option pricing model is a simple lattice-based method for valuing options.

2. **Trinomial Model**
   - The Trinomial option pricing model extends the Binomial model by allowing for three possible price movements at each step.

3. **Bjerksund-Stensland Model**
   - The Bjerksund-Stensland option pricing model is an extension of the Black-Scholes model that incorporates early exercise features and barriers.

4. **Black-Scholes Model**
   - The Black-Scholes option pricing model is a widely-used model for valuing European options.
